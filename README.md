# Augmented Finance Protocol

This repository contains the smart contracts source code and markets configuration for Augmented Finance Protocol.

## What is Augmented Finance?

**Augmented Finance** is a DeFi liquidity protocol for high-yield lending and low-interest borrowing of digital assets, launched fairly and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). 

Augmented Finance is on a mission to help you achieve and secure financial independence and be your trusted long-term source of income and liquidity.

## Tokenomics

**Total supply**: 100 000 000 AGF, released over 5 years.

**Fair launch**: no pre-mine, no pre-sale, no ICO, no VC allocation. Unlike Aave and Compound where the majority of tokens distributed to ICO participants or Venture Capital funds, almost all AGF tokens will be distributed to the Augmented Finance protocol's users who actively use the protocol (borrow, supply, stake & lock).

## Pools:

| Pool | % of Total AGF |
| ---- | :------------- |
|Liquidity Incentives | 52% |
|Staking Incentives | 25% |
|Referral Incentives | 2% |
|Token Burner Incentives| 1% |
|Dev Fund | 10% |
|Ecosystem Fund | 10% |

**Augmented Finance’s tokenomics** is engineered to benefit the protocol's users, increase the protocol’s total value locked (TVL), and bolster the protocol's resilience through all market cycles.

## AGF

**Augmented Finance token** (AGF) is the native token of the Augmented Finance ecosystem and the foundation of economics, governance, and safety for the protocol:

A user can lock AGF for a period from 1 week to 4 years, and receive xAGF to unlock the following use cases:

1. Boost Yields (up to 4x) on:
- supply and borrow of assets
- staked agTokens (Augmented Finance's interest-bearing tokens)
- staked AGF-ETH UNI LP (Uniswap liquidity pool tokens)
2. Profit-share protocol fees (coming soon)
3. Vote on various DAO proposals and protocol parameters (coming soon)

## Supply & Borrow

**Suppliers** (lenders) earn high APY on supported assets supplied to the protocol, with the highest safety (e.g. supply USDC, earn interest in USDC, and receive liquidity incentives in AGF).

**Borrowers** pay low interest on supported assets borrowed from the protocol, with the highest safety (e.g. borrow USDC, pay interest in USDC, and receive liquidity incentives in AGF).

## Stake

**Stake AGF-ETH UNI LP tokens**: deposit your AGF and ETH to the AGF-ETH pool on Uniswap, get AGF-ETH UNI LP (Uniswap liquidity pool tokens) and earn trading fees, stake your UNI AGF-ETH LP to Augmented Finance’s staking module to earn more AGF and increase the safety of the Augmented Finance protocol.

**Stake agTokens**: supply the supported assets to the protocol, stake your agTokens (Augmented Finance’s interest-bearing tokens — agUSDC, agUSDT, agDAI, agWBTC, agETH) to Augmented Finance’s staking module, receive more AGF and increase the safety of the Augmented Finance protocol.

## Lock AGF to Boost Yields

**Lock**: lockup AGF for a period from 1 week to 4 years to receive xAGF. 

**Boost**: Holding xAGF gives a boost (up to 4x) of AGF incentives for those who actively use the protocol — supply and borrow supported assets, stake agTokens (Augmented Finance's interest-bearing tokens), and stake AGF-ETH UNI LP (Uniswap liquidity pool tokens). 

**The users who lock AGF and actively use the protocol — get the maximum amount of AGF incentives.**

## Trade

Trade AGF on the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) — Uniswap. More exchanges (both decentralized and centralized) will be added later.

## Security

The Augmented Finance protocol security and safety is at the high level: 

1. The **protocol code** will be made **open** and **thoroughly audited** before the launch
2. The **bug bounty** program will be started 
3. Fast **customer support** and **security alerts** 

Augmented Finance’s team has developed a world-class lending and borrowing protocol to meet the existent needs of users and unlock the intelligent DeFi era. Join us to unlock a new level of innovation in DeFi and power a brand new generation of decentralized intelligent financial services.
