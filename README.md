## What is Augmented Finance?

Augmented Finance is on a mission to build an open, efficient, and globally accessible financial system. We are building an autonomous, non-custodial liquidity protocol which yields the highest interest on deposits, while facilitating the borrowing of digital assets at the lowest rates. Augmented Finance is built to unlock the world of open financial applications. AGF tokens will be the key component of the Augmented Finance ecosystem. The tokens are used for governance and staking, with more utilities to be added as the Augmented Finance user base grows.
